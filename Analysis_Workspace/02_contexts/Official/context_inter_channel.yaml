family: inter_channel

scope:
  coverage: partial
  objective: >
    Identify inter-channel asymmetry, abnormal correlation, or structured
    information carried in the differential (L−R) signal.
  rationale: >
    Metrics highlight structured inter-channel relationships rather than
    perceptual stereo quality.
