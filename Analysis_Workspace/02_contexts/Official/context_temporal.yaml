methods:
  envelope:
    scope: "per_channel"
    metrics:
      envelope_mean:
        unit: "amplitude"
        reference: { status: "C" }
        notes:
          - "Envelope magnitude is scale-dependent; no stable numeric reference."
      envelope_max:
        unit: "amplitude"
        reference: { status: "C" }
        notes:
          - "Envelope magnitude is scale-dependent; no stable numeric reference."
      envelope_std:
        unit: "amplitude"
        reference: { status: "C" }
        notes:
          - "Envelope magnitude is scale-dependent; no stable numeric reference."
      envelope_length:
        unit: "samples"
        reference: { status: "C" }
        notes:
          - "Length depends on analysis configuration; no reference range."

  autocorrelation:
    scope: "per_channel"
    metrics:
      autocorr_max:
        unit: "normalized correlation"
        reference:
          status: "A"
          typical_range: [-1.0, 1.0]
        notes:
          - "Normalized autocorrelation is bounded in [-1, 1]."
      autocorr_mean:
        unit: "normalized correlation"
        reference:
          status: "A"
          typical_range: [-1.0, 1.0]
        notes:
          - "Normalized autocorrelation is bounded in [-1, 1]."
      first_peak_lag:
        unit: "samples"
        reference: { status: "B" }
        notes:
          - "Lag depends on sampling rate and signal class."
      num_peaks:
        unit: "count"
        reference: { status: "B" }
        notes:
          - "Peak count depends on detector parameters."
      periodicity_score:
        unit: "normalized correlation"
        reference:
          status: "A"
          typical_range: [-1.0, 1.0]
        notes:
          - "Derived from normalized autocorrelation."
