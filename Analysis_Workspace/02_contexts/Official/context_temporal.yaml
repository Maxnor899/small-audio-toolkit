family: temporal

scope:
  coverage: partial
  objective: >
    Identify periodicity, repetition, and non-random temporal structure
    in audio signals.
  rationale: >
    This context focuses on stable scalar temporal metrics suitable for
    high-level forensic screening. It does not aim to exhaustively cover
    all temporal-domain measurements.
