scope:
  coverage: partial
  objective: >
    User-specific contextual ranges intended for project- or corpus-level
    positioning of selected scalar metrics.
  rationale: >
    This user context defines reference ranges derived from an internal corpus
    or project-specific assumptions. These ranges are not part of the official
    SAT documentary references and may not generalize beyond their intended scope.
