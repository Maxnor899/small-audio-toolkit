# USER_DOC_Level_1 — How to Think About SAT

## Purpose

This document explains **how SAT should be approached mentally before using it**.
It does not explain how to run commands or read files.
Its role is to set expectations and prevent common misunderstandings.

If you are looking for practical steps, start with **USER_GUIDE_QUICKSTART.md**.

## What SAT is

SAT is a tool designed to **observe audio signals through multiple independent measurements**.

It:
- computes objective measurements,
- exposes them in a structured way,
- and lets humans reason about them.

SAT helps you **look more carefully** at a signal.
It does not tell you what the signal *means*.

---

## What SAT is not

SAT is deliberately **not**:

- a detector,
- a classifier,
- a decision engine,
- a “one-click answer” tool.

SAT never produces a verdict.
If you are looking for certainty, SAT is the wrong tool.

## A useful metaphor: the cocktail 🍹

Using SAT is like tasting a complex cocktail.

You do not decide what it is based on a single sip.
You:
- notice sweetness,
- bitterness,
- acidity,
- balance,
- aftertaste.

Each element tells you **something**, but none tells you **everything**.

SAT works the same way:
- each analysis observes one aspect of the signal,
- meaning only emerges when observations are combined by a human.

## How to use SAT safely

A few simple rules help avoid common mistakes:

1. **Never rely on a single metric**
   One value alone is never decisive.

2. **Look for consistency**
   Patterns that appear across multiple analyses matter more.

3. **Compare scopes and channels**
   Differences between channels or segments are observations, not conclusions.

4. **Treat contexts as references**
   Contexts help positioning, not judgment.

5. **Keep hypotheses human**
   SAT provides data; interpretation remains your responsibility.

## Common pitfalls

- Treating SAT outputs as answers
- Searching for a “detection threshold”
- Over-interpreting a single score or plot
- Forgetting which protocol produced the results

SAT is intentionally conservative to protect you from these traps.

## Where to go next

- **USER_GUIDE_QUICKSTART.md** — practical first steps
- **USER_DOC_Level_2.md** — understanding workflows and artefacts
- **USER_DOC_Level_3.md** — system design and methodology (advanced)
- Functional documentation — deeper conceptual reading

## Final note

SAT does not replace reasoning.
It supports it.

If you feel uncertain after using SAT, that is normal.
Uncertainty means you are observing carefully.
