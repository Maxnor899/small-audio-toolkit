# USER_GUIDE_QUICKSTART.md

## Purpose
This document is a minimal, practical entry point for using SAT.
It deliberately avoids technical details and focuses on *what to do* and *what to read*.

---

## 1. Typical use cases

You may want to use SAT when:
- You want to explore an unknown audio file
- You want to compare multiple audio files using the same protocol
- You want objective measurements before forming hypotheses

SAT does **not** provide answers by itself.
It provides structured observations.

---

## 2. Minimal workflow

### Step 1 — Choose an audio file
Select the audio file you want to analyse.

### Step 2 — Run a baseline analysis
Run SAT with a baseline protocol.
This produces a results file and reports.

### Step 3 — Read the outputs
Start with:
1. Measurement summary
2. Methodology guide
3. Contextual positioning (if contexts are enabled)

Do not start with conclusions.

---

## 3. How to read results safely

- No single metric is decisive
- Look for consistency across families
- Look for persistence across channels or segments
- Treat context positioning as reference, not judgment

---

## 4. What to do next

After a first run, you may:
- Run a more focused protocol
- Compare results across files
- Introduce a user-defined context

Each step refines observation, not truth.

---

## 5. Common mistakes to avoid

- Treating SAT as a detector
- Interpreting a single score
- Ignoring protocol differences
- Assuming contexts are authoritative conclusions

---

## 6. Where to go next

- USER_DOC_Level_1.md — conceptual mindset
- USER_DOC_Level_2.md — advanced understanding
- Functional documentation — deeper reading
