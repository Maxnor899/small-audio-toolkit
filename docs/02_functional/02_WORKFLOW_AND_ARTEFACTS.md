# 02 – Workflow and Artefacts

## End-to-end functional workflow
Audio → protocol → measurements → results → reports

## Artefacts
- results.json: factual record of observations
- Reports (01–04): human-readable summaries
- Visualizations: optional reading aids

## Reproducibility
Identical inputs and protocol produce identical measurements.
