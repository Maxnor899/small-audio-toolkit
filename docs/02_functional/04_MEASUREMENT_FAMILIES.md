# 04 – Measurement Families

## Purpose
Describe what each family observes conceptually.

## Families
### Temporal
Amplitude evolution, periodicity, timing characteristics.

### Spectral
Frequency content and distribution.

### Time–frequency
Evolution of spectral content over time.

### Modulation
Amplitude and frequency modulation characteristics.

### Information
Entropy, complexity, and information density measures.

### Inter-channel
Relationships between channels.

### Steganography
Indicators related to signal structure alterations.

### Meta-analysis
Aggregation and comparative summaries.

## Common limitations
Noise sensitivity, stationarity assumptions, SR dependency.
