# 01 – Functional Overview

## Purpose
This document defines what SAT does from a functional perspective.
It explains goals, vocabulary, and conceptual boundaries, without referencing implementation details.

## Objectives
- Provide objective signal measurements
- Serialize observations for human or external-system analysis
- Support comparative and contextual reading

## Explicit non-objectives
- No classification or detection
- No automated decision-making
- No interpretation of intent or meaning

## Core concepts
- Signal, channel, scope, segment
- Measurement vs metric
- Analysis vs reporting vs contextualization

## What SAT produces
- Raw measurements
- Scalar metrics
- Positioning information (optional, via contexts)
