# A1 – Functional Glossary

## Purpose
This glossary defines the functional vocabulary used throughout the SAT documentation.
Terms are defined conceptually, without reference to implementation details.

## Core terms
- Signal: audio data under analysis.
- Channel: a single audio stream derived from the signal (e.g., left, right).
- Scope: the logical level at which a measurement applies (global or per-channel).
- Segment: a time-bounded window of observation.
- Measurement: any raw value or structure produced by an analysis.
- Metric: a scalar measurement suitable for comparison or positioning.
- Family: a conceptual grouping of analyses with similar observation goals.
- Protocol: a strategy defining what aspects of the signal are observed.
- Context: a declarative reference used for positioning metrics.
- Positioning: comparison of a metric against a declared reference range.
