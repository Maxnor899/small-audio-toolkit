# A2 – Reference Reading Guide (No Conclusions)

## Purpose
This document provides examples of how SAT outputs may be read factually,
without drawing conclusions or making classifications.

## Example patterns
- Persistent asymmetry between channels across multiple metrics.
- High variability of a metric across segments.
- Consistent positioning above reference ranges for several related metrics.

## Important note
These examples illustrate *reading strategies*, not interpretations.
SAT does not infer meaning or intent from these patterns.
