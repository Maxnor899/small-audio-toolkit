# A3 – Functional Context Authoring Guide

## Purpose
This guide explains how to design useful contexts from a functional perspective,
without describing file formats or validation rules.

## Principles
- Contexts should document reference ranges, not decisions.
- Coverage may be partial and should be explicit.
- Notes should explain provenance and limitations of references.

## Responsibilities
- Official contexts: maintained by the project, conservative by design.
- User contexts: reflect specific hypotheses or datasets.

## Non-goals
Contexts should not embed heuristics, scoring, or classification logic.
