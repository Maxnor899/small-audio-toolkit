# Context Examples

This directory contains **contextual reference examples** for the Small Audio Tool.

These files provide **comparative reference ranges only**.
They do **not** define thresholds, rules, detections, classifications, or interpretations.

Contexts are:
- optional,
- external to analysis,
- descriptive only,
- fully traceable.

They are intended to help **position measured values**, not to explain them.

---

## Important

- Contexts never influence measurements.
- Contexts never imply intent, meaning, or anomaly.
- Interpretation is always external and human.

Use these examples as **starting points**, not as authoritative truths.
