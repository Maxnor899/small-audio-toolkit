  Contextual reference ranges for general audio signals.
  These references provide comparative positioning only.
  They do not imply interpretation or detection.

references:

  temporal.autocorrelation.max_peak_excluding_zero:
    unit: "normalized"
    typical_range: [0.0, 0.2]
    notes:
      - "Higher values indicate stronger repetitive structure."

  spectral.spectral_flatness:
    unit: "ratio"
    typical_range: [0.2, 0.6]
    notes:
      - "Lower values are commonly observed in tonal or structured spectra."
      - "Higher values are common in noise-like signals."

  spectral.spectral_centroid:
    unit: "Hz"
    typical_range: [500, 4000]
    notes:
      - "Centroid position depends strongly on signal type and bandwidth."

  time_frequency.band_stability.mean:
    unit: "normalized"
    typical_range: [0.0, 0.3]
    notes:
      - "Higher stability reflects persistent energy in fixed bands."

  modulation.am_detection.modulation_index:
    unit: "ratio"
    typical_range: [0.0, 0.3]
    notes:
      - "Stronger modulation increases index values."

  information.shannon_entropy:
    unit: "bits/sample"
    typical_range: [3.5, 5.5]
    notes:
      - "Lower values often occur in repetitive or highly structured signals."
      - "Higher values are typical of broadband noise."

  information.compression_ratio:
    unit: "ratio"
    typical_range: [1.5, 4.0]
    notes:
      - "Higher ratios indicate greater redundancy."

  inter_channel.cross_correlation.max:
    unit: "normalized"
    typical_range: [0.0, 0.5]
    notes:
      - "Higher correlation reflects stronger channel similarity."

  inter_channel.time_delay.delay_samples:
    unit: "samples"
    typical_range: [-10, 10]
    notes:
      - "Larger delays may reflect intentional offsets or processing artifacts."
